Utilized Python libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib) for data preprocessing and visualization on the winequality-red.csv
dataset.
• Performed feature engineering and classification of wine quality into "Good," "Middle," and "Bad" categories.
• Applied machine learning algorithms including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Trees, KNN, and Naive Bayes.
• Tuned hyperparameters using GridSearchCV to optimize model performance.
• Evaluated models using confusion matrices and classification reports; achieved an accuracy of 88.8% with SVM.
• Visualized model comparisons and results with detailed performance metrics.
